## 🧩 Let's Play A Game
- I am creating an issue in which you have to either decode the JavaScript [File](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/Portfolio_Vanilla-Js/blob/main/js/index.js) or you can write your own code to achieve the same functionality. This will be a solid test of your fundamentals. Create a Pull Request to merge the changes.

- However, if you feel that you need the js file for your learning then create an issue with label as `JS File Needed`. I will add it in the repo.
